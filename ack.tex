I want to thank the members of my lab, past and present, who provided me with feedback, inspired me with their enthusiasm, and created a cordial, pleasant, and intellectually stimulating environment to work in.
 
I want to thank the Biological Design Advising Staff for their help and kindness, the School of Life Sciences for the teaching assistant positions over the years, and the National Science Foundation for funding parts of this work.
